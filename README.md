# The Mooqita Worklearn Platform
The worklearn platform powers the [Mooqita](https://www.mooqita.org) app.

## Quick Start

Mooqita is built on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and deployed on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com) with automatic staging of our [master branch](https://github.com/Mooqita/worklearn/tree/master).

### Local Development

Command to start a local development instance: "meteor --settings settings.json"
Until we switch to a proper "first start procedure": consider adjusting ./server/server.coffee for generating an admin user
