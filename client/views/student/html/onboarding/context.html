        <h2>Welcome to Mooqita!</h2>

	    <div class="taskDescription">
	    	<p><strong>Mooqita can supplement your online course by providing you with additional tasks and challenges authored by educators and industry professionals.</strong></p>
	        <p>In order to ensure you are given content which you'll find the most interesting and relevant to your learning, we need to ask you a few questions about what you find interesting on your course and your opinions on some example tasks.</p>
	        <p>We'll also ask you for some basic information about how you like to work, helping us match you into a team with like-minded individuals.</p>

	        <p>This process should only take a few minutes!</p>
